 1. Per issue on Github, you should create a branch. example: `[type]/[issue#]`
    - Per feature you should create a feature branch. ie. `feature/1001`.
    - Per bug you should create a fix branch. ie. `fix/1002`.
    - Per task you should create a task branch. ie. `task/1003`
 2. Commits need to reference the issue that is being worked on. example: `updated copy #1004` or `fixes #1005`
    - It's also good to to add the amount of time to your commit message. example: `fixed button #1006 30m` or `built awsome feature #1007 16h`
 3. When you are finished with your branch, you should create a pull request back to the `main` branch.
    - Assign another developer to review your code. 
    - All contributors are expected to both write and review code.
